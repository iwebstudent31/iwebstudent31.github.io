                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">07/12/19</div>
                <p>This week, I worked on catching up on my webstie, by adding some of my Custom UI Designs that I made
                    in Adobe XD, and imported them using a code called Fancybox. Fancybox helped me with the
                    presentation of my images on the website, so it wouldn't redirect me to a whole new URL. I also
                    learned about new Design Patterns that are used in all sorts of websites, to help with the User
                    Experience and the User Interface Design, otherwise known as UX and UI. </p>

                <div class="date">07/05/2019</div>
                <p>Since I was abesent for the past three weeks, I tried to catch up on all of the past assignments and
                    work my way to making and developing my website. This involved learning about all sorts of code
                    including HTML and CSS I also learned what certain softwares were such as, VS Code, Adobe XD,
                    Github, etc. I look forward to making the rest of my website next week, and also look forward to
                    exploring many more new things in the world of code. </p>
