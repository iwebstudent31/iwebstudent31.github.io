                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/05/2019</div>
                <p>Since I was abesent for the past three weeks, I tried to catch up on all of the past assignments and
                    work my way to making and developing my website. This involved learning about all sorts of code
                    including HTML and CSS I also learned what certain softwares were such as, VS Code, Adobe XD,
                    Github, etc. I look forward to making the rest of my website next week, and also look forward to
                    exploring many more new things in the world of code. </p>
